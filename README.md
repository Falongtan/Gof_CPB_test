This R code implements the methodologies developed in the following work for ultra-high dimensional sparse parametric regressions:

A Two-Step Projection-Based Goodness-of-Fit Test: This paper proposes a two-step strategy that first constructs multiple test statistics based on projected predictors from distinct projections to mitigate the dimensionality problem. The second step employs p-value combination procedures (e.g., the minimum p-value and the Fisher combination) to form the final tests. It is particularly powerful for detecting local alternatives as if the predictor were univariate.
