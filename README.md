This R code implements the methodology developed in the following work for ultra-high dimensional sparse parametric regressions:

A Two-Step Projection-Based Goodness-of-Fit Test for Ultra-High Dimensional Sparse Regressions(The corresponding link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10721) : This paper proposes a two-step strategy that first constructs multiple test statistics based on projected predictors from distinct projections to mitigate the dimensionality problem. The second step employs p-value combination methods (e.g., the minimum p-value and the Fisher combination) to form the final test statistics. This projection-based approach significantly mitigates the dimensionality problem, enabling the tests to detect local alternatives converging to the null at the rate as if the predictor were univariate.
